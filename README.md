ðŸ“Œ Project Title 
Customer Retention Insights: Telecom Sector Dashboard
A dynamic Power BI solution designed to monitor and improve customer retention using telecom service dataâ€”focusing on churn patterns, regional insights, and customer behavior analysis.

ðŸ“Š Short Description / Purpose
The Customer Retention Insights Dashboard is a business-focused analytics tool developed to help telecom stakeholders analyze churn rates, understand customer retention metrics, and drive strategic decisions. This dashboard evaluates customer behavior across 8 regions and 50+ SKUs, highlights high-risk churn segments, and identifies opportunities to improve lifetime value and reduce customer attrition.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

ðŸŸ¨ Power BI Desktop â€“ Core platform for building visual reports and KPI dashboards.

ðŸŸ¦ Power Query â€“ Used for transforming, reshaping, and cleaning raw telecom data.

ðŸ’¬ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ Implemented for calculated columns, churn KPIs, AOV, repeat rates, and conditional metrics.

ðŸ”— Data Modeling â€“ Linked churn, transactions, customer segments, and product data for cross-filtering and segmentation.

ðŸ§  Python â€“ Built a logistic regression churn model with 85% accuracy for predictive insights.

ðŸ“„ File Format â€“ .pbix for the dashboard, .xlsx/.csv for raw data, and .png for dashboard preview thumbnails.

ðŸ“‚ Data Source
The project used cleaned and structured telecom service data based on IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset (publicly available).

Covers 7,000+ customer records, including details on tenure, contract types, payment methods, monthly charges, and churn history.

Weekly aggregated metrics generated for trend tracking and churn analysis.

Applied RFM segmentation and churn prediction over transactional behavior to provide deeper retention insights.
